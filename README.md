Get and Set Elements: Access and modify matrix values.
Matrix Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, and multiplication of sparse matrices.
Usage
Prepare Input Files: Ensure your input files are formatted correctly, with the first two lines indicating the number of rows and columns, followed by data triplets in the format (row, col, value).

Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
node script.js
Example: The example at the end of script.js demonstrates loading two matrices and performing operations.
